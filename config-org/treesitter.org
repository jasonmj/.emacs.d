* Treesit
This file is the Lisp counterpart of treesit.c.  Together they provide tree-sitter integration for
Emacs.  This file contains convenient functions that are more idiomatic and flexible than the
exposed C API of tree-sitter.  It also contains frameworks for integrating tree-sitter with
font-lock, indentation, activating and deactivating tree-sitter, debugging tree-sitter, etc.
